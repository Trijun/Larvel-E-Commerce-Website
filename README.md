Hi everyone,

I faced some difficulties when I tried to create a Larvel Project, and here is a video explanition on how I solved it, https://www.loom.com/share/1203c96f90b94b2c9aa6a06cfd335035


Here are the links to the StackOverFlow pages that you see in the video:

Final Error - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69325402/trying-to-create-new-laravel-project-this-error-came-up
